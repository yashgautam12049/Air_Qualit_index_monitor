# Air Quality Monitoring System

This repository contains the project synopsis for the Air Quality Monitoring System, developed as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) course at Netaji Subhas University of Technology.

## Project Overview

The project deals with a real-time air quality monitoring system using the MQ135 gas sensor. The system predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) around a specific locality. Monitoring AQI is crucial today due to the increase in diseases caused by poor air quality, such as asthma.

### Abstract

Due to urbanization, industrialization, and the increasing number of vehicles, pollution has become a significant issue affecting human health and the environment. This project proposes an air quality monitoring system that tracks the current air quality levels using MQ135 sensors. The data is processed by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which receives input from the sensors and displays the results.

### Purpose

The purpose of the air quality monitoring project is to:

1. **Health Protection**: Identify and monitor harmful pollutants to safeguard public health.
2. **Environmental Awareness**: Raise awareness about the impact of air quality on health and the environment.
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize air quality data.
4. **Alert System Implementation**: Notify users when air quality levels exceed predefined thresholds.

### Methodology

1. **Hardware Components**:
   - **MQ135 Gas Sensor**: Detects toxic gases like NH3, CO2, and benzene steam.
   - **Arduino Uno**: Microcontroller to process sensor data and control output devices.
   - **WiFi Module**: Sends data to a remote server for real-time monitoring.
   
2. **Software Components**:
   - **Arduino IDE**: Used for programming the Arduino microcontroller.
   - **ThingSpeak**: Online application for storing and visualizing data from the IoT devices.
   
3. **Approach**:
   - Monitor air quality using MQ135 sensors.
   - Display AQI values on an LCD screen.
   - Alert users when AQI crosses a harmful threshold.
   - Send data to a remote server for continuous monitoring and analysis.

### Future Enhancements

- Integrate cloud technology for more efficient data management.
- Use machine learning algorithms to predict AQI more accurately.
- Implement additional sensors to measure temperature, pressure, and humidity.
- Develop a mobile app to notify users about air quality in real-time.
